Screening policies and quarantine policies:
-We swab an agent at most one time for each day.
-New school's policy (December 2021 - January 2022): if we find an infected student into a classroom we put this student in quarantine and we swab all the other students in the same classroom; if we find other num-infected-needed-to-quarantine-whole-classroom - 1 infected students, then we quarantine the whole classroom. Otherwise we put only the new detected infected students in quarantine and we swab again all the negative students after number-of-after-days-special-swab days. Again, if we have at least num-infected-needed-to-quarantine-whole-classroom infected students in that classroom, then we quarantine the whole classroom. Otherwise we put only the new detected infected students in quarantine.
